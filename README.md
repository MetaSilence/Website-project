# Website-project
My school website project

The bears title is placed depending on the size of the webpage. Use in full screen for best results. 

Ignore my image formating for better grading quality. 

The size of my urls is like that because for some reason it doesn't want to display a tinyfied url.

Here are my "inspirations" for my code: 

formspark gave me my form code, though i did get their product and they have a free shoutout everythime someone sends a message. 

w3 didn't give me my navbar, though i stole the color scheme. (I made my navbar using CSS grid, not toying with padding.)

Thats about it.
